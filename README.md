# Audio-to-Sign-Language-Converter
Introduction: 
It is said that Sign language is the mother language of deaf people. This includes the combination of hand movements, arms or body and facial expressions. There are 135 types of
sign languages all over the world. Some of them are American Sign Language (ASL), Indian Sign Language (ISL), British Sign Language (BSL), Australian Sign Language (ASL) and many more.

We are using Indian Sign Language in this project. This system allows the deaf community to enjoy all sort of things that normal people do from daily interaction to accessing the information. This application takes speech as input, converts it into text and then displays the Indian Sign Language images.
